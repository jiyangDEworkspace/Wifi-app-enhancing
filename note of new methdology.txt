note of new methdology
1. methdology was introduced to make software predictable and efficient
2. engineering methdology: planning inspired by other disciplines. failed because so many stuffs need to do.
3. Agile methdology: just enough process. code oriented. Adaptive and people oriented.
4. So the approach for software engineering methodologies looks like this: we want a predictable schedule that can use people with lower skills.it can look very good on paper, yet be seriously flawed when you actually have to program the thing. In software the amount of time spent in coding is much, much less. In building business software requirements changes are the norm. After all software is supposed to be soft. If you cannot get stable requirements you cannot get a predictable plan. Instead you need a process that can give you control over an unpredictability. That's what adaptivity is all about. The key to iterative development is to frequently produce working versions of the final system that have a subset of the required features.  A usable, although minimal, system can go into production early on. The customer can then change its capabilities according to changes in the business, and also from learning from how the system is used in reality. In an agile project there is a constant reworking of the plan with every iteration. A project that's on-time and on-cost is considered to be a success. For agilists the question is business value - did the customer get software that's more valuable to them than the cost put into it.
